# ReactEscrow

**Reactive Milestone-Based Escrow Protocol on Somnia Testnet**

Built for the [Somnia Reactivity Mini Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io) (Feb 25 – Mar 20, 2026).

ReactEscrow lets a client lock funds on-chain for a freelancer across multiple milestones. When the client approves a milestone, **Somnia Reactivity** automatically pushes a callback to an on-chain handler contract — releasing funds to the freelancer with no manual step, no keeper bot, and no polling.

## How It Works

Traditional escrow requires someone to manually release funds after approval — a middleman, a cron job, or the user pressing "Release" a second time. ReactEscrow eliminates that entirely using **Somnia Native Reactivity**.

**End-to-end flow:**

1. **Client creates an escrow** — sets milestones (description, STT amount, deadline) and locks funds in the smart contract.
2. **Freelancer submits work** — marks the milestone as submitted when the deliverable is ready.
3. **Client approves** — one click. The contract emits a `MilestoneApproved` event on-chain.
4. **Somnia validators detect the event** — because `ReactiveHandlers.sol` is a registered subscriber via the Somnia Reactivity precompile (`0x0100`). No keeper bot, no oracle, no polling.
5. **Funds auto-release** — validators atomically call `ReactiveHandlers._onEvent()` → `ReactEscrow.releaseMilestoneFunds()`. The freelancer receives payment in the same block as the approval.
6. **Frontend updates in real-time** — the off-chain `reactive-service` subscribes to the same events via Somnia's WebSocket SDK and pushes live updates to the browser.

The same reactive pattern handles disputes (arbiter resolves → `DisputeResolved` → funds distributed instantly), missed deadlines (`DeadlineReached` → timeout auto-release), checkpoint partial payments (`CheckpointApproved` → streaming release), and proof-of-delivery challenge expiry.

> Somnia Reactivity is not a webhook or an oracle. It is a validator-enforced, on-chain primitive — the callback is atomic with the triggering transaction, with no trusted intermediary.

**Reactivity is used in two ways:**
- **On-chain** — `ReactiveHandlers.sol` auto-executes fund releases via validator callbacks
- **Off-chain** — `reactive-service` streams live event data to the frontend via the Somnia SDK WebSocket

## Feature Highlights

| Feature | What It Does | Reactive Triggers Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Proof-of-Delivery** | Freelancer submits deliverable hash; if it matches the committed hash, a challenge period starts. If unchallenged, funds auto-release. | `DeliverableVerified` → challenge timer → `MilestoneApproved` |
| **Streaming Payments** | Milestones split into weighted checkpoints. Each checkpoint approval streams proportional payment to freelancer. | `CheckpointApproved` → `releaseCheckpointFunds()` per checkpoint |
| **Hook Registry** | Modular post-release hooks. Any contract can register to execute on milestone completion. | Cascading calls from `ReactiveHandlers` → `HookRegistry` → registered hooks |
| **NFT Receipts** | Non-transferable ERC721 minted automatically on every milestone release. On-chain proof of completed work. | Fired by `EscrowReceiptNFT` hook in same reactive callback |
| **Reputation SBT** | Soulbound token tracking escrow history with Merkle proof verification. Prove your track record without revealing individual contracts. | Fired by `ReputationHook` on escrow completion |

Every feature above executes **automatically via Somnia Reactivity** — no keeper bots, no user action, no off-chain triggers.

## Why Somnia Reactivity?

ReactEscrow could not achieve the same guarantees on any other chain. Here's why:

**Atomicity** — Fund release happens in the same block as milestone approval. Chainlink Keepers, Gelato, or any keeper-based system introduces at minimum a 1-block delay (often 30s–5min). On Somnia, the validator executes the callback atomically — there is no window where the milestone is approved but funds haven't moved.

**Zero Infrastructure** — No keeper bots to deploy, monitor, fund, or maintain. No cron jobs. No off-chain trigger service. The reactive subscriptions are registered once and the chain handles everything. This eliminates an entire class of operational risk.

**Sub-Cent Cost** — The 5-step reactive chain (release funds → mint NFT receipt → update reputation → execute hooks → update status) costs fractions of a cent on Somnia. On Ethereum, firing 5 contract calls in one flow would cost $20+. On L2s, still $0.50+. Somnia makes complex reactive chains economically viable.

**Sub-Second Finality** — Streaming partial payments via checkpoint approvals work because each checkpoint payment confirms before the next one fires. On chains with 12s+ block times, streaming payments would batch awkwardly.

**Protocol-Level Trust** — The reactive callback is executed by Somnia validators, not by a third-party keeper network. The trust assumption is the same as the chain's consensus — you trust the validators to execute blocks correctly, and the reactive callback is part of that execution.

## 5 Advanced Features

### Feature 1 — Privacy-Preserving Milestones (Commit-Reveal)

Milestone amounts can be hidden on-chain using **keccak256 commit-reveal**:

- At escrow creation the client submits `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(amount, salt))` instead of a plain amount.
- The salt is stored in the browser (`localStorage`), invisible to on-chain observers.
- When the client approves, they call `approvePrivateMilestone(escrowId, milestoneIndex, amount, salt)`.
- The contract verifies `keccak256(amount, salt) == commitment`, sets `milestone.amount`, emits `MilestoneApproved` — and Reactivity auto-releases as normal.

Select **Private** mode in the Create Escrow form.

---

### Feature 2 — Proof-of-Delivery Oracle (Hash Verification + Challenge Period)

Escrows can require the freelancer to submit a hash matching a pre-agreed deliverable spec:

- Client specifies a `bytes32` deliverable hash per milestone at creation (plain text is keccak256-hashed in the UI).
- Freelancer calls `submitMilestoneWithDeliverable(escrowId, idx, hash)`. If hashes match, a **challenge window** opens (default 48h).
- During the window, the client can call `challengeDeliverable()` to dispute.
- After the window, anyone calls `checkAndTriggerChallengeExpiry()` → emits `DeliveryChallengePeriodExpired` → Reactivity auto-approves and releases.

Select **Delivery Proof** mode in the Create Escrow form.

---

### Feature 3 — Streaming Partial Payments (Checkpoints)

Milestones can be split into weighted checkpoints, enabling streaming payment as work progresses:

- Client calls `addMilestoneCheckpoints(escrowId, milestoneIdx, descriptions[], weights[])` — weights must sum to 100.
- Freelancer submits each checkpoint; client approves each one.
- On `approveCheckpoint`, the contract emits `CheckpointApproved(escrowId, milestoneIndex, checkpointIndex, amount)`.
- **Reactivity** auto-calls `releaseCheckpointFunds()` — transferring `milestone.amount * weight / 100` to the freelancer immediately.
- When the last checkpoint is released, the milestone advances automatically.

---

### Feature 4 — Cross-Contract Composability (Hook Registry + NFT Receipt)

A pluggable hook system fires after every milestone release:

- `HookRegistry` holds a list of `IEscrowHook` contracts.
- `ReactiveHandlers` calls `registry.executePostReleaseHooks(...)` after each successful `releaseMilestoneFunds`.
- Each hook is called in a `try/catch` — a failing hook never reverts the release.
- **EscrowReceiptNFT** is the first registered hook: mints an ERC-721 receipt to the freelancer with on-chain metadata (escrowId, milestoneIndex, amount, timestamp encoded as base64 JSON tokenURI).
- New hooks can be registered by the registry owner without redeploying ReactEscrow.

---

### Feature 5 — Reputation SBT (Soulbound Token + Merkle History)

Freelancers earn a non-transferable reputation token that grows with every completed escrow:

- `ReputationSBT` is an ERC-721 with transfers blocked (`_update` override in OZ v5).
- `ReputationHook` (registered in HookRegistry) calls `sbt.mintOrUpdate(freelancer, escrowId, amount, ...)` on each milestone release.
- On-chain stats tracked per address: `totalEscrows`, `totalAmountEarned`, `disputeCount`, `lastUpdated`.
- A **Merkle root** of the full earnings history is stored on-chain, updatable by the off-chain `reactive-service/src/merkle.ts` worker.
- The `verifyReputationClaim(user, leaf, proof)` view function lets anyone verify historical claims.
- View the `/reputation` page in the frontend to look up any address.

## How Somnia Reactivity Works Here

```
Client approves milestone
        │
        ▼
ReactEscrow.sol emits  MilestoneApproved(escrowId, milestoneIndex, amount)
        │
        ▼ (Somnia validators detect subscribed event — atomic, no intermediary)
ReactiveHandlers._onEvent() is called in the same block
        │
        ▼
ReactiveHandlers calls ReactEscrow.releaseMilestoneFunds()
        │
        ▼
Funds transferred to freelancer — no user action needed
```

Four subscriptions registered via `setup-subscriptions.ts`:

| Event | Handler Action |
|---|---|
| `MilestoneApproved` | calls `releaseMilestoneFunds()` → pay freelancer |
| `DeadlineReached` | calls `executeTimeoutRelease()` → timeout auto-release |
| `DisputeResolved` | calls `executeResolutionDistribution()` → split per arbiter ruling |
| `CheckpointApproved` | calls `releaseCheckpointFunds()` → partial streaming payment |

---

## Reactive Subscription Map

Every event emitted by ReactEscrow triggers a cascade of automatic actions via Somnia Reactivity:

```
ReactEscrow Events                    ReactiveHandlers Actions
──────────────────                    ────────────────────────
MilestoneApproved ──────────────────► releaseMilestoneFunds()
                                           │
                                           ├──► HookRegistry.executePostReleaseHooks()
                                           │         ├──► EscrowReceiptNFT.mint()
                                           │         └──► ReputationHook.update()
                                           │
CheckpointApproved ─────────────────► releaseCheckpointFunds()
                                           │
                                           └──► HookRegistry.executePostReleaseHooks()

DeadlineReached ────────────────────► executeTimeoutRelease()

DisputeResolved ────────────────────► executeResolutionDistribution()

DeliverableVerified ────────────────► (starts challenge period countdown)
                                           │
                                           └──► on expiry: MilestoneApproved (re-enters flow above)
```

**5 event types → 8+ reactive actions → zero human intervention after the triggering transaction.**

**Milestone Statuses:** `Pending` → `Submitted` → `Approved` → `Released` (or `Disputed`)

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- MetaMask browser extension
- STT tokens on Somnia Testnet — get from the [faucet](https://testnet.somnia.network)
- For testnet subscriptions: **34+ STT** in the deployer wallet (precompile deducts from `msg.sender`)

---

## Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install root deps (Hardhat + contracts)
git clone <repo-url>
cd react-escrow
npm install

# 2. Install frontend deps
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# 3. Install reactive-service deps
cd reactive-service && npm install && cd ..

# 4. Copy and fill environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set PRIVATE_KEY (without 0x prefix)
```

---

```

---

## NPM Scripts

Run all from the project root:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run compile` | Compile Solidity contracts |
| `npm test` | Run 168 Hardhat unit tests |
| `npm run deploy:local` | Deploy to local Hardhat node |
| `npm run deploy:testnet` | Deploy to Somnia Testnet |
| `npm run setup-subscriptions` | Register 4 Somnia Reactivity subscriptions |
| `npm run seed` | Create sample escrows on testnet |
| `npm run frontend` | Start React dev server (http://localhost:5173) |
| `npm run reactive-service` | Start off-chain WebSocket event service (ws://localhost:3001) |

---

## Deploy to Testnet (Step-by-Step)

```bash
# 1. Add Somnia Testnet to MetaMask
# Chain ID: 50312 | RPC: https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/ | Symbol: STT

# 2. Get STT from the faucet (need 34+ STT in deployer wallet)
# https://testnet.somnia.network

# 3. Set PRIVATE_KEY in .env

# 4. Deploy all 6 contracts (ReactEscrow, ReactiveHandlers, HookRegistry,
#    EscrowReceiptNFT, ReputationSBT, ReputationHook) + wire them
npm run deploy:testnet
# → writes deployment.json, updates .env, updates frontend/.env

# 5. Register 4 on-chain Somnia Reactivity subscriptions
#    (Deployer wallet must hold ≥ 32 STT — precompile checks msg.sender balance)
npm run setup-subscriptions

# 6. Start the off-chain reactive service
npm run reactive-service

# 7. Start the frontend
npm run frontend
# → open http://localhost:5173
```

> **Note on STT balance:** The Somnia Reactivity precompile (`0x0100`) deducts gas from the **subscription owner's wallet** (the deployer) on each callback. Keep 34+ STT in the deployer address to keep subscriptions active. Use `ReactiveHandlers.withdraw(amount)` if you need to recover any STT sent to the handler contract.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

168 tests across all contract paths:

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `ReactEscrow.test.ts` | 68 | Core escrow lifecycle, access control, reentrancy, Reactivity simulation |

## Key Technical Notes

### Somnia Reactivity — On-Chain Path

- `ReactiveHandlers` inherits `SomniaEventHandler` from `@somnia-chain/reactivity-contracts@^0.1.6`
- The base `onEvent()` validates `msg.sender == 0x0100` before calling `_onEvent()`
- Event topics decoded from `eventTopics[0]` (keccak256 of event signature string)
- `escrowId` is always `eventTopics[1]` (first indexed param)
- Non-indexed params decoded from `data` via `abi.decode`
- All handler calls wrapped in `_safeCall()` — handler errors never revert the validator invocation
- After each milestone release, `HookRegistry.executePostReleaseHooks()` fires all registered hooks (each try-caught independently)

### Somnia Reactivity — Off-Chain Path

- `reactive-service` uses `@somnia-chain/reactivity@^0.1.10` SDK
- Connects via WebSocket transport (`wss://dream-rpc.somnia.network/`)
- `sdk.subscribe()` receives raw `{ topics, data }` push from Somnia validators
- `handlers.ts` decodes all event types and converts to `ParsedEvent` JSON
- Broadcasts to all connected frontend clients over a local WebSocket server on port 3001
- On `FundsReleased`: optionally updates the off-chain Merkle tree for reputation history

### Frontend

- Reads via `createPublicClient` + HTTP (viem v2)
- Writes via `createWalletClient` + `custom(window.ethereum)` (MetaMask)
- `useReactivity` hook maintains a WebSocket connection to the reactive-service with auto-reconnect
- `CreateEscrow` supports 3 modes: **Standard**, **Private** (commit-reveal), **Delivery Proof** (hash + challenge window)
- `EscrowDetail` renders panels per mode: `CheckpointPanel`, `DeliveryPanel`, `PrivateRevealPanel`
- Commit-reveal salts stored in `localStorage` keyed `commitment:{escrowId}:{milestoneIndex}`
- Solidity version: **0.8.30** (required by `SomniaEventHandler.sol`)

### Contract Design Constraints

- All 5 features added via **new mappings** — no existing struct fields were changed
- `createEscrow` / `approveMilestone` / all original functions remain 100% backward-compatible
- `IEscrowHook` interface enables permissionless extensibility without redeploying the core contract
